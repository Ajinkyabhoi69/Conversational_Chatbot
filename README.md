# Conversational Chatbot Application with LangChain and Streamlit

# RAG-Based AI Application with Deepseek-R1:1.5B

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that enables users to upload PDF and audio files to extract meaningful information and generate text and voice-based responses using Deepseek-R1:1.5B AI model. The application is built using Streamlit, LangChain, and Ollama, with additional reinforcement learning (RLHF) for continuous improvement.

## 🎯 Features

- 📄 PDF & Audio File Upload - Process both text and speech-based inputs
- 🎙 Speech-to-Text (STT) - Convert uploaded audio files into text
- 🔍 Vector Embeddings & Retrieval - Enables fast and context-aware search
- 🤖 Deepseek-R1:1.5B AI Model - Generates intelligent responses
- 🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS) - Outputs responses in both text and audio
- 📊 Reinforcement Learning (RLHF) - Users can rate responses as Good/Bad, improving model accuracy over time
- 🖥 Streamlit UI - Interactive and user-friendly interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Streamlit - Web UI framework
- LangChain - For RAG and text processing
- Ollama - Embeddings & LLM integration
- Deepseek-R1:1.5B - AI model for response generation
- PDFPlumber - PDF text extraction
- SpeechRecognition - Convert voice to text
- pyttsx3 - Text-to-speech for voice output
- InMemoryVectorStore - Efficient semantic search

## 🏗️ Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local system.
2. Install the required dependencies to ensure all necessary packages are available.
3. Run the application to start interacting with the RAG system.

## 📌 Usage Guide

- Upload a PDF or Audio File.
- If uploading an audio file, the system will transcribe it into text.
- The Deepseek-R1:1.5B AI model generates an intelligent response.
- The response is provided in text and voice format.
- Users can rate responses (Good/Bad) to help improve model performance.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Support for additional file formats like DOCX, TXT, etc.
- Multi-language support for better accessibility.
- Integration with cloud-based vector databases for scalability.
- Real-time voice interaction for a more conversational AI experience.
- Voice command support for specially-abled individuals to enhance accessibility.
